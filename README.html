<p><strong>Environment</strong>: a 10 m x 10 m field</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Environment: a 1 m x 1 m field.</p></li>
<li><p>Five agents (A,B,C,D,E) can move up and down and left and right, one centimeter in every step.</p></li>
<li><p>Assume the agents have unlimited power supply.</p></li>
<li><p>For each agent, there are five targets to collect. For example for agent A the targets are TA1 to</p></li>
</ol>
<p>TA5.</p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Whenever a relevant target (for example TA3) is reachable by its related agent, the object is</li>
</ol>
<p>considered as collected and will disappear from the field.</p>
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>All targets and agents are randomly scattered all over the field. Agents do not have any</li>
</ol>
<p>information about the location of none of the targets and other agents.</p>
<ol start="7" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Agents have location sensor (x,y) to locate itself.</p></li>
<li><p>Agents have been given (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) so they can identify the border of the domain.</p></li>
<li><p>Agents never run out of fuel.</p></li>
<li><p>Every agent has a Radar to sense targets or other agents. The Radar can sense the type (which</p>
<p>agent belongs to) and locate every target or agent in 10 centimeter radius. Whenever an agent</p>
<p>locates a target (or an agent), it will receive the coordinates (x,y) of the target (or agent).</p></li>
<li><p>A target (or agent) is reachable by an agent if it falls into its Radar range (10cm).</p></li>
<li><p>Every agent has two communication channels: First is a public channel for broadcasting. In</p>
<p>broadcast mode, the message sent by an agent will be received by all other agents. Second, a</p>
<p>private channel to send private messages to a specific agent.</p></li>
<li><p>In both channels, agents can send any type of message but a mandatory message will be sent in</p>
<p>broadcast mode by an agent that collected its all targets.</p></li>
<li><p>Agents avoid colliding each other. They will never remain reachable by other agents.</p></li>

<h1 id="implement-the-following-scenarios">Implement the following scenarios:</h1>
<h2 id="scenario-1-completion">Scenario 1: Completion</h2>
<ul>
<li>The game will be over as soon as one of the agents collects all its objects.</li>
<li>Only public communication channel is open for all agents. The private channels are closed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scenario-2-collaboration">Scenario 2: Collaboration</h2>
<ul>
<li>The game is not over until all agents collect their own target objects.</li>
<li>Both public and private channels are open. Example of a private communication: Agent A encounters object TB1. It may or may not notify the object B the location of TB1.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scenario-3-compassionate-agents">Scenario 3: Compassionate agents</h2>
<ul>
<li>The game will be over as soon as one of the agents collects all its objects.</li>
<li>Both public and private channels are open. Example of a private communication: Agent A encounters object TB1. It may or may not notify the object B the location of TB1.</li>
